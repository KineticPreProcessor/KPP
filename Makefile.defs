# In order to compile KPP you have to provide the following information:

# 1. The name of the compiler you want to use. Normaly this 
#    is either GNU C compiler (gcc) or the native compiler (cc)
#    You can use the complete pathname if the compiler is not in $PATH 
#    Note that for SUN machines is better to use gcc.
#    For GNU C compiler use:
#      CC=gcc
#    For the native compiler use:
#      CC=cc

CC=gcc 

# 2. The name of your lexical analizer. KPP requires FLEX to be used.
#    FLEX is a public domain lexical analizer and you can download it from
#    http://www.gnu.org/software/flex/ or any other mirror site. If flex
#    directory is not included in your path use the complete pathname.

FLEX=flex

# 3. The complete pathname of the FLEX library (libfl.a).
#    On many systems this is either: 
#    /usr/lib, /usr/lib64, /usr/local/util/lib/flex

FLEX_LIB_DIR=/usr/lib64

# 4. Platform independent C compiler flags. By default "-O" is used which 
#    turns on optimization. If you are experiencing problems you may try 
#    "-g" to include debuging informations.

CC_FLAGS= -g -Wall

# 5. Path to include additional directories
#    Typically: /usr/include on Linux
#               /usr/include/sys on Mac OS X
INCLUDE_DIR = /usr/include
