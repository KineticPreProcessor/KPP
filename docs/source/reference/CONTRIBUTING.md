## Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for looking into contributing to GEOS-Chem! GEOS-Chem
is a grass-roots model that relies on contributions from community members
like you. Whether you're new to GEOS-Chem or a longtime user, you're a
valued member of the community, and we want you to feel empowered to contribute.

#### We use GitHub and ReadTheDocs
We use GitHub to host the KPP-for-GEOS-Chem source code, to track issues, user questions, and feature requests, and to accept pull requests: [https://github.com/geoschem/KPP](https://github.com/geoschem/KPP). Please help out as you can in response to issues and user questions.

We use ReadTheDocs to host the KPP-for-GEOS-Chem user documentation: [https://kpp.readthedocs.io](https://kpp.readthedocs.io).

#### How to submit changes
We use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), so all changes happen through pull requests. This
workflow is described here: [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html). If your change affects multiple
submodules, submit a pull request for each submodule with changes, and link to these submodule pull requests in your main pull request.

As the author you are responsible for:
- Testing your changes
- Updating the user documentation (if applicable)
- Supporting issues and questions related to your changes in the near-term

#### Coding conventions
The GEOS-Chem codebase dates back several decades and includes contributions from many people and multiple organizations.
Therefore, some inconsistent conventions are inevitable, but we ask that you do your best to be consistent with nearby
code.

#### How to request an enhancement
We accept feature requests through issues on GitHub. To request a new feature, [open a new issue](https://github.com/geoschem/KPP/issues/new/choose) and select the feature request template. Please include all the information that might be relevant, including the motivation for the feature.
