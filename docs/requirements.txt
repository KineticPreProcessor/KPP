# Requirements for building the KPP documentation
#
# NOTE: There are issues with sphinx 4.0.0+ and sphinx-rtd-theme 1.0.0
# so we'll use older versions (Bob Yantosca, 03 May 2022)
#
# ALSO NOTE: A recent update to jinja2 has broken backwards c
# compatibility with the older ReadTheDocs package, so we need to
# use a version of jinja2 prior to 3.1.0. (Bob Yantosca, 03 May 2022)

sphinx<4.0.0
sphinx_rtd_theme<1.0.0
