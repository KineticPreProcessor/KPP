## Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for looking into contributing to KPP!  KPP is an open-source
package that relies on contributions from community members
like you. Whether you're a new or longtime KPP user, you're a
valued member of the community, and we want you to feel empowered to
contribute.

#### We use GitHub and ReadTheDocs
We use GitHub to host the KPP source code, to track issues, user
questions, and feature requests, and to accept pull requests:
[https://github.com/KineticPreProcessor/KPP](https://github.com/KineticPreProcessor/KPP). Please
help out as you can in response to issues and user questions.

We use ReadTheDocs to host the KPP user documentation: [https://kpp.readthedocs.io](https://kpp.readthedocs.io).

#### How to submit changes
We use [GitHub
Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html),  so all changes happen through pull requests. This
workflow is described here: [GitHub
Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html). If your
change affects multiple submodules, submit a pull request for each
submodule with changes, and link to these submodule pull requests in
your main pull request.

As the author you are responsible for:
- Testing your changes
- Updating the user documentation (if applicable)
- Supporting issues and questions related to your changes in the near-term

#### Coding conventions
The KPP codebase dates back several decades and includes contributions
from many people and multiple organizations. Therefore, some
inconsistent conventions are inevitable, but we ask that you do your
best to be consistent with nearby code.

feature, [open a new
